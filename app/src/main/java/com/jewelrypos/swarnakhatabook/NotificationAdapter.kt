// Potential issues in NotificationAdapter.kt:
// 1. The onBindViewHolder method likely sets up the dismiss button click listener
//    which might be setting up multiple click handlers or not properly handling lifecycle
// 2. The onDismissButtonClick method in the adapter might not be checking if the listener is null 
//    before invoking it
// 3. There might be issues with how the adapter is handling item updates after dismissals
